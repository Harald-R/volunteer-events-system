# Backend Server

This server application provides the main source of communication for this system. It presents a REST API for easy user authentication & manipulation, as well as for events manipulation.

## Running the application

First, start the database daemon from a terminal:

`mongod`

Then, in a different terminal, start the server:

`npm run start`

## REST API

The documentation for the REST API can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kA8sqyQ7Sjjkoab7YEJEaFQWwQ2xz-U0jJt168zgATo/edit#gid=0).

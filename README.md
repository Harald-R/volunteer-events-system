# Volunteer Events System

This repo contains four different applications, designed as parts of a whole system. The system represents a way for NGOs to create events that volunteers can announce their participation in.

## Details

The four applications are inter-connected and represent the following:
- an Android client application that allows volunteers to view events and announce their wish to participate in them;
- an Android (or web?) client application that allows NGOs to create and update events, as well as post news about them;
- a server application that receives requests from NGOs and volunteers, deals with the back-end logic and the database maintenance;
- a server application that notifies users when new events are available or NGOs when new users want to participate in their events.


## Notes

This was created as a University project.
